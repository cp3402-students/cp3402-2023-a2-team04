=======
<p>Version control was done through GitHub. Multiple branches were used, primarily Main, Staging, and Development. The workflow for a member to commit a change to the project, would go as follows; Create a new branch, commit changes to it and then merge it with the development branch. Before the merge would be accepted it would need to be reviewed by other members in the pull request.</p>
