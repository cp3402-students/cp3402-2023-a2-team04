# Site

## Goal (Measurable):

The goal of the website is to increase membership sign-ups by 15% (excluding the first month) within 6 months of launch
of the new website.

## Success Evaluation

On initial launch of the site, the first month would be considered successful if there is at least 50% of existing
members signed up as a member to the website.

The conversion rate will be used to measure the long-term success of this goal, whereby 15 percent of visitors to the
site sign up as a member for a period of six-months. This long term goal should see that new memberships signups are
achieved.

## Target Audience

The site is targeted at individuals aged between 17-80 that has an interest in participating or spectating country music
gigs. As it is a local association, it is targeted at the geographic area of the Townsville region. In order to cater to
this particular target audience the theme should play on warm or natural tones of the countryside, relaxed fonts for
headings, but ensure that reading fonts are clear and well-sized for older readers.

## Market Size

The population of the Townsville region is approximately 178,000 people. The potential market size is calculated based
on the likely percentage of having an interest in country music, one study showed in Australia that approximately 24% of
Australian's preferred country music. This targets approximately 42,720 of Townsville's population with a potential to
spectate or listen to country music. Another study from 2007 suggests that 35% of households contain at least one person
who plays a musical instrument, with a household average in at 2.59 as of 2021 this means there is a potential market
size of 5000-6000 people.
