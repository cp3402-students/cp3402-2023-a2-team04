# Theme

This documentation is intended for new developers to continue the development of heartland hits. It details the features
of the theme, what requires editing, design decisions, colours and other aspects.

## Features

**Custom Logo:**

* A custom logo that can be added into the header.

**Custom Header Image:**

* A custom header image that can be added. It will not appear on smaller screens to save space and only appears on the
  front page.

**Social Media Icons:**

* Social media icons appear in the footer.

**Header and Footer Navigation:**

* A secondary navigation menu for shorter or custom navigation in the footer.

**Newsletter:**

* Any post that uses the 'newsletter' category will automatically use the Newsletter template. Formatted to display the
  selected newsletter at the top and a list of other available newsletters from the past, organised by date. It is a
  requirement that the post publication date must be set to the date that this newsletter corresponds to for this to
  work.

## Design

### Layout

A global layout file is used for general content areas to apply across multiple pages or posts. Add in any general
styling into this file.

### Colours

Enter into the colour.scss variables file. The colours used should be under the colour variables section; whilst the
colours used in each element should be listed by purpose. This will ensure that changing all site colours can occur from
a single location.

## Continued Development

### New Site Parts

Site specific sections should be added under the sass/site folder e.g. header and footer. Any of these items should have
their import statements added to the site.scss file.

Any scss that impacts globally across the entire site should be added to the global.scss file.

### Requires Attention

The Google fonts were attempted to be added to the functions.php enqueue, but only the first font would be accessible. A
import statement in the typography file was used to use all fonts, but is not the ideal solution. This requires further
attention.
